# Generate color palettes with HSLuv and Python

Python scripts to generate color palettes using the [HSLuv](https://www.hsluv.org/) color space («a human-friendly alternative to HSL»). This color space allows to find colors with the same saturation value and colors with the same lightness value.

Therefore, HSLuv allows to find the contrast between two colors, complementary colors, analogous, triadic and tetradic, keeping the same contrast ratio.
